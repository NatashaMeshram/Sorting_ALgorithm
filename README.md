#Visualization of Sorting Algorithms
This project, created for academic purposes, visualizes popular sorting algorithms. It currently includes:
1.Bubble Sort
2.Insertion Sort
3.Selection Sort
4.Future updates may add more algorithms, like Merge Sort.

#Features
1.Interactive Controls: Adjust sorting speed and array size.
2.Algorithm Selection: Choose a sorting algorithm and order (ascending/descending).
3.Info Display: Shows each algorithm's complexity and stability.
